## About Flash Coins
Flash coins are cryptocurrencies that briefly appear in your wallet but don't remain there long. These can include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), or Solana (SOL). Flash WBTC coins are often used by scammers or for demonstration purposes in controlled environments.
